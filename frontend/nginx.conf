    # try_files is the key to making client-side routing work.
    # It tells Nginx to first look for a file that matches the request URI.
    # If it doesn't find one, it looks for a directory with that name.
    # If that also fails, it serves /index.html as a fallback.
    # This ensures that your React Router can handle the routing for any path.

  # Optional: You can add headers here for security or caching.
  # For example, to prevent clickjacking:
  # add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
